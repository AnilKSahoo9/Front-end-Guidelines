# Front-end Guidelines

## Introduction
During my 15 years of experience in web development, I’ve worked with various companies, from enterprise-level to startups, and I’ve worked with many, many fellow software engineers along the way. One of the most common and important problems I’ve came across in my projects has been failure to write clean and easy-to-understand code. 
Even the best developers from top-notch companies don’t always follow best practices and write code which can be cleaned and optimized.

## Problems and consequences of messy and dirty code
> “Source code is akin to financial debt. Suppose you want to buy a house to live in. Most people don’t have the financial wherewithal to pay cash for a house, so you take out a mortgage instead. But the mortgage itself is not a great thing to have. It’s a liability. You have to pay interest on your debt every month. You always want your mortgage to be as small as possible while still allowing you to buy a house that meets your needs. But if you don’t do some careful thinking about the terms and implications of your mortgage before you buy a house, you can wind up in a load of trouble. It’s possible to end up underwater in a situation where your debt is actually bigger than your house is worth.

> So too in web development. The code has ongoing costs. You have to understand it, you have to maintain it, you have to adapt it to new goals over time. The more code you have, the larger those ongoing costs will be. It’s in our best interest to have as little source code as possible while still being able to accomplish our business goals.”
